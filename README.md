# Python-Lesson3
This is the third lesson of python. These are the topics discussed.

1. Conditional Statements- They allow you to execute different blocks of code based on specific conditions.
    1. The if statement is used to test a condition. If the condition evaluates to True, the block of code within the if statement will be executed.
    2. The elif (short for "else if") statement allows you to check additional conditions if the initial if condition is False. Multiple elif statements can be used to handle various scenarios.
    3. The else statement executes a block of code when all preceding conditions are False. It acts as a fallback option.
The if, elif, and else keywords are used to implement these statements, enabling decision-making in your programs.

2. Loops- Loops are used to execute a block of code multiple times.
    1. The for loop iterates over a sequence (like a list or string).
    
    2. The while loop continues executing as long as a specified condition remains true.
Both are essential for repetitive tasks.

3. List Comprehensions- They provide a concise way to create lists in Python. They allow you to generate a new list by applying an expression to each item in an existing iterable, often resulting in cleaner and more readable code.

4. Python Functions- Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They can accept inputs (parameters) and return outputs. Defining functions helps organize code and promotes code reuse.

5. Functions and Variable Scopes- Variable scopes determine the visibility of variables within your code.
    1. Local scope refers to variables defined within a function.
    
    2. Enclosing scope involves nested functions.
    
    3. Global scope pertains to variables defined at the top level of a module.
    
    4. Built-in scope includes names pre-defined by Python.

6. Lambda Functions- These are anonymous, single-expression functions defined using the lambda keyword. They are useful for creating small, throwaway functions without the need for a formal function definition, often used as arguments in higher-order functions.

7. Built-in Functions- Python provides numerous built-in functions that perform common tasks, such as len(), max(), min(), and type(). These functions enhance productivity and simplify code writing by providing ready-to-use functionality.

8. Weekly Code Challenge
    1. Large Power: This challenge involved creating a large_power() function (or lambda function) that checks if a number raised to a certain exponent exceeds 5000, returning True or False accordingly.
    2. Divisible by 10: This challenge required writing a divisible_by_10() function (or lambda function) that checks if a given number is divisible by 10, returning True if it is and False if it isn't.
